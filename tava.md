			#The future of aritificial intelligence
			#The future of aritificial intelligence
			AI is evolving day by day and it is believed that in the near future, ai is going to change human life very drastically.
			With the help of A.I, machines will be able to learn, solve problems, plan things, think, etc.
			Application areas of ai are having a huge impact on various fields of life to solve complex problems. the various areas such as

			Transportation: Tesla is already using AI to help its cars drive themselves, and it’s not alone. Google’s self-driving cars are also using AI to help them navigate the roads. In the future, AI will help cars drive themselves, and it will help them communicate with each other to avoid accidents.

			Manufacturing:  Robots are already used in manufacturing, but they’re about to get a lot smarter. They’ll be able to work alongside humans, and they’ll be able to learn from their mistakes.

			Healthcare:  AI is already being used to help doctors diagnose patients, and it’s about to get a lot better. AI will be able to help doctors make better diagnoses, and it will be able to help them make better decisions about treatment.

			Education: Textbooks are digitized with the help of AI

			Customer Service: AI is already being used to help companies provide better customer service. 

			behind it's pro's there are some cons it can be dangerous for us. If we become completely dependent on machines, then it can ruin our life. We will not be able to do any work by ourselves and made us lazy. Another disadvantage is that it cannot give a human-like feeling. So machines should be used only where they are actually required.

			Conclusion:
				Ai is the  emerging technology for many of the sectors. I conclude that it is a great technology, but it must be used, without being harmful as long as we manage to keep the technology beneficial, and we have limited way for it to work effectively.
