Abilities: due to no exams students are not able to know their abilities performance, knowledge, skills.

Disruption of the academic calendar: The cancellation of exams has disrupted the usual flow of the school year and led to a loss of instructional time. This can make it more difficult for students to learn and retain information, and may also impact their overall grades and academic progress.

Increased uncertainty and anxiety: The cancellation of exams can create uncertainty and anxiety for students, particularly those who were preparing for important exams such as the SAT or ACT, or those who were planning to apply to college or university. This is because the cancellation of exams can affect students' grades, rankings, and admissions decisions.


Logistical challenges: For schools, the cancellation of exams has also posed logistical challenges, such as how to assess and grade students' learning in a fair and consistent manner.


Challenges with remote learning: For many students, the cancellation of exams has occurred alongside the transition to remote learning, which can be challenging for some students due to a lack of access to resources or a supportive learning environment at home.
