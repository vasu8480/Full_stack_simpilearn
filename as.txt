#impact of no exams in pandameic
As a result of the pandemic, exams were cancelled or postponed, having a significant impact on students, schools, and the education system.

Abilities: due to no exams students are not able to know their abilities performance, knowledge, skills.

Disruption of the academic calendar: Due to the cancellation of exams, the school year has been disrupted and teaching time has been lost. The difficulties associated with this can also negatively affect students' academic performance and grades.

Increased uncertainty and anxiety: When exams are canceled, it can be extremely stressful for students, especially those preparing for critical exams such as gate and all India level exams or applying to colleges. Students' grades, rankings, and admissions decisions can be affected by exam cancellations.

Logistical challenges: Moreover, the cancellation of exams poses logistical challenges, such as how to assess and grade students' learning fairly and consistently.


Challenges with remote learning: Due to lack of access to resources and a supportive learning environment at home, many students have had their exams cancelled along with the transition to remote learning.

#Assignments and projects:
	These can be a good way to assess students' learning, but they can also be challenging for students who are struggling with remote learning. For example, students may not have access to the resources they need to complete their assignments, or they may not have a supportive learning environment at home. This can make it more difficult for students to complete their assignments, and may also impact their grades and academic progress.

#Oral or written presentations:
	These can be a good way to assess student understanding and communication skills, and can be done online or in person with appropriate social distancing measures in place.

#Peer assessment:
	This involves students evaluating and providing feedback on the work of their peers.Peer assessment can be a good way to involve students in the assessment process and can also help to develop their critical thinking and communication skills.

#Portfolios:
	Students gather and present a collection of their work over time. Portfolios can be a good way to assess students' progress and learning, as well as help them reflect on what they have learned.


# Some of the specific job-related challenges that final year students may have faced during the pandemic include:
Fewer job openings: 
	The cancellation of exams has led to a decrease in the number of job openings, which can make it more difficult for students to find employment.Many businesses had to reduce their staffing levels or put hiring on hold due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Goverment jobs were also not available

Remote hiring:
	For example, many companies have had to switch to online exams or interviews, which can be challenging for students who do not have access to the resources they need to participate in online interviews, such as a computer or a stable internet connection.

Lack of work experience:
	When students are in their final year of study, they often have to take part in internships or work experiences to be able to make a strong impression on employers.

Due to the pandemic, students have been adversely affected by the cancellation of exams. Due to unexpected challenges, organizations need to be more flexible and adaptable. Students' progress and learning can also be measured using alternative assessment methods.
